        <!-- where lifecycle is known as the series of events that happen from the creation of a component to its destruction.
         For example when we click on the toggle box, the box will created and in another click it will destroyed. -->

        <!-- Why we need lifecycle hooks?
         This is used in various checking place like
         to check if the user is authorized
         APIs calls
         Creating and removing the events
